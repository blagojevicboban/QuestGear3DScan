# QuestGear 3D Scan

This is the companion application to **QuestGear 3D Studio**, designed to run on **Meta Quest 3** headsets.

## Purpose

QuestGear 3D Scan facilitates the capture of high-quality data for 3D reconstruction. It records:
- **RGB Images**: High-resolution color frames.
- **Depth Maps**: Raw depth data from the Quest depth sensor.
- **Pose Data**: precise 6DoF tracking information for each frame.

## Workflow

1.  **Capture**: Launch this app on your Quest 3 and scan your subject.
2.  **Export**: Transfer the captured data to your PC via USB or Wi-Fi.
3.  **Process**: Use **QuestGear 3D Studio** to reconstruct the detailed 3D model.
